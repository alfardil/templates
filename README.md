# Templates

A bunch of templates to speed up the development when starting new projects.

[This](./fastapi_with_o4_mini) is the template for a FastAPI backend initialized with streaming and non-streaming endpoints with a o4-mini call.
[This](./go_with_react_google_auth/) is the template for a Golang backend initialized with Google auth and a React (ShadCN) frontend.
